    title: 'Line-Following Robot Using Arduino',
    description: (
      <>
        <strong>Description:</strong>
        <p>For this project, I developed a line-following robot using an Arduino microcontroller and infrared (IR) sensors. The robot is designed to autonomously follow a black line on a white surface by continuously adjusting its direction based on real-time sensor feedback. It utilizes three IR sensors positioned on the front: one on the left, one in the middle, and one on the right. These sensors detect the contrast between the black line and the white surface, allowing the robot to make directional adjustments to stay on track.</p>

        <strong>Key Features:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Proportional Line Following:</strong> The robot adjusts its speed and direction depending on which sensors detect the line. If the left or right sensor detects the line, the robot adjusts by turning slightly or sharply in that direction. If the middle sensor detects the line, the robot moves forward.</li>
          <li><strong>Line Search Mechanism:</strong> In the event that all sensors lose track of the line, the robot enters a search mode where it spins in place until it reacquires the line.</li>
          <li><strong>Smooth Movement:</strong> The robot dynamically adjusts its turning speed based on sensor input, allowing for smooth and accurate tracking with minimal erratic movements.</li>
        </ul>

        <strong>This Project Demonstrates My Skills In:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Embedded Systems Programming:</strong> Using the Arduino IDE, I wrote custom code that manages sensor input and motor control.</li>
          <li><strong>Sensor Integration:</strong> By carefully calibrating the IR sensors, I ensured reliable detection of the line under various lighting conditions.</li>
          <li><strong>Motor Control:</strong> I controlled the robot’s motors using PWM (Pulse Width Modulation), allowing for precise speed adjustments.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>This project showcases my ability to design and implement autonomous systems, combining hardware (sensors, motors) and software to solve a practical robotics challenge.</p>
