      <h2>Early Life</h2>
      <p>I was born in Chernivtsi, Ukraine, a vibrant city that set the stage for my interests and early development. My childhood was filled with a mix of academic and extracurricular activities—I went to school early and spent my high school years exploring a range of passions. I attended classes in dancing, piano, and guitar, as well as participated in sports like football, volleyball, basketball, and table tennis. My favorite pastime, however, was playing billiards with my father, which remains one of my cherished memories.</p>

      <h2>Move to Poland</h2>
      <p>In middle school, I realized my fascination for computer science. This discovery inspired me to learn Polish and, at the age of 17, move to Poland to pursue higher education in computer science. I initially studied in Lublin, but found myself struggling to adjust; I couldn't find a job to sustain myself, and my Polish wasn't yet strong enough to secure a good position. Moreover, the university wasn't offering what I had hoped for, so I decided to move to Szczecin.</p>

      <h2>Szczecin and Malta</h2>
      <p>Szczecin marked a turning point. I found friends, strengthened my skills, and gained valuable work experience—especially during my time as a Master Data Specialist. This role helped me understand data management at a deeper level and become an effective member of a corporate team. In early 2024, I took another leap by joining the University of Malta as an exchange student. I fell in love with Malta's culture and lifestyle, which prompted me to switch my studies to part-time and stay on the island, becoming self-employed as a real estate agent.</p>
